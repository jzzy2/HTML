<h2 id="1parag">Paragraph 1</h2>
<p>Four score and seven years ago our fathers brouht forth on this continent a new nation,conceived in
in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that al men are created equal</p>

<h2 id="2parag" >Paragpraph 2</h2>

<p>Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing wheter that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, cam long endure. 
We are met on a greate battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting 
place for those who here game their lives that that nation might live. It
is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this</p>

<h2 id="3parag" >Paragpraph 3</h2>

<p>But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate—we can not consecrate—we can not hallow—this ground. The brave men, 
living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, 
nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here 
to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great 
task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure 
of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth 
of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.</p>
